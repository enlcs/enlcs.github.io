## Panentheism según Grok

I assume you meant "panentheism." Panentheism is a philosophical and theological concept that posits God or the divine is both immanent within the universe and transcendent beyond it. Unlike pantheism, which equates God with the universe (everything is God), panentheism holds that the universe is part of God, but God is more than just the universe—extending beyond it in some way.

The term comes from Greek roots: "pan" (all), "en" (in), and "theos" (God), suggesting "all-in-God." It’s often described as a middle ground between traditional theism (where God is wholly separate from the universe) and pantheism. In panentheism, the divine permeates or interpenetrates the cosmos while retaining a distinct identity or essence that isn’t fully exhausted by the material world.

Historically, panentheistic ideas appear in various traditions. For example, some interpretations of Neoplatonism, certain strands of Christian mysticism (like in the works of Meister Eckhart), and aspects of Hindu philosophy (such as in the Bhagavad Gita or Advaita Vedanta with qualifications) align with panentheistic thought. Modern thinkers like Alfred North Whitehead and process theology have also embraced it, emphasizing a dynamic relationship between God and the world where both evolve together.
